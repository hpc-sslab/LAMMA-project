This directory includes source codes to solve elliptic PDEs with simple quadrature rules for the family of nonparametric nonconforming quadrilateral element with four degrees of freedom.

It also includes test data files.   

Use Makefile to generate an executable file.

In data file, users can choose various finite element spaces, newly designed gauss quadrature rules, and iterative solvers to solve discrete sparse linear system.
