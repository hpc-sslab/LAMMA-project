This directory includes source codes to solve Stokes problem for the family of nonconforming quadrilateral element P1 element with three degrees of freedom.

The main source code is enclosedcavity.m
For the Stokes flow, the indefinite discrete linear system is obtained,
algebraic multigrid smoothers are used in iterative solver MINRES.
